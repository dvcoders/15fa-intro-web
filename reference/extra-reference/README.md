Here is a collection of really awesome ideas you should know, but didn't make it into the main Intro Web Guide

### What is a packet?

A packet is a tiny piece of the original file which is being sent — (either from the client or to the client).

It's very efficient to break a large file into smaller bits, send them to the their destination computer, and have that computer reassemble them into the original file.

Packaging a file can be thought of as cutting a glass into pieces and sending them to a friend with instructions on how to erasable the vase. One, you've just saved a lot space in mailing the glass for your friend to drink with. Two, your friend does all the work reassembling it. Three, it was efficient to send because it was precisely cut and sent with specific instructions.

We've covered how the the internet is structured, but how does the computer sending the data know *where* it needs to go? That's where IP Addresses come in!

### How is information broken down and sent?

To serve or send a web page, file, picture, or video directly would be very hard! These files can be very large and sending them would take ages!

Sending data requires **three** key things:
  1. Rules for "packaging" data - (breaking into tiny pieces)
  2. An interconnected network to send over - (ex.the internet)
  3. A way to "route" the data to the computer which needs to receive it — (IP Address)
