## Intro Web Guide

### What is the internet?

The internet is simply a global connection of computer networks.

Your home network connects to a network in your city, which connect to a larger network in your region, then to other networks in the country, which connect to networks around the world.

Through these connections your computer has connection to other computers. 

Some of these computers are called "servers". Servers are the backbone of the internet, they store content and "serve" them to users around the world. Servers need to more powerful than the average computer in order to handle up hundreds or millions of requests.

## Client

A client can be a computer's browser, a phone, a tablet, or anything else which accepts interactions with the user.

### What is HTML?

HyperText Markup Language is a markup language used to add structure and content to webpages.


HTML is composed of a series of tags such as `<p>` (paragraph) and `<img>` (image) to indicate different types of content. The `<div>` tag is used to break up groups of content.
  

Your browser interprets the tags and uses them to display the content how it is specified.


HTML follows the Document Object Model (DOM) convention. The DOM is a "tree" or "hierarchy" composed of objects. HTML elements are objects in the tree. Tags such as `<p>` and `<img>` specify elements. The DOM is called a "tree" because elements can be "children" of an element, or "parents" of elements as well.

### What is CSS

Cascading Style Sheets is a language used to design the appearance and formatting of a webpage.

### How does the browser work?
- Rendering html
- rendering CSS
- Optimization
- Sanboxing

### How the browser gets HTML/CSS from a server?
- Browsers and servers need to interact in a  **fixed** and agreed upon manner
- We can call this a protocol


## HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Earlier we talked about [clients and servers](https://github.com/dvcoders/intro-web#what-is-a-client-what-is-a-server). Now, we're going to talk about a *protocol* which is simply a standard for enabling the connection, communication, and data transfer between two places on a network.

There are a few type of protocols which are used on the web: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and WebSockets. 

For the sake of convenience we are going to familiarize you with HTTP (the most common protocol between clients and servers).

To double back to our restaurant example from earlier, there are **four primary actions** in an HTTP request which describe what interactions the client and server are able to have.

| METHOD | MEANING                                                                                                          | RESPONSE                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | **Request** some specific data from the server <br>Ex. "Could I have another spoon?"                                     | The server gives the client back the requested data (if it exists). Could be an HTML file, a PDF, or [JSON data](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/json/).<br>Ex. "Here is your spoon" Success!     |
| POST   | **Insert** some data into the server <br>Ex. "I would like to order the spaghetti"                                       | The client gives the server the data you wish to insert. Usually, this would be in JSON form. <br>Ex. "Your order has been placed" Success!                                                         |
| PUT    | **Update** an existing piece of data <br>Ex. "Could you tell the chef to make my pasta extra spicy?"  | The client tells the server **what** needs to be **updated**  Usually with some ID or name, as well as the data. <br>Ex. "Just in time, the chef made your meal extra spicy" Success!          |
| DELETE | **Delete** an existing piece of data <br>Ex. "I would like to cancel my order, you restaurant sucks!" | The client tells the server **what** needs to be **deleted**. This time you only need to give the ID, the server will handle the actual deleting. <br>Ex. "Alright, your order has been canceled" Success! |

<small>**JSON** stands for *Javascript Object Notation*. It is a way to model objects using JavaScript notation and you will come to *love* it! [Here's a quick example](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/json/)</small>

[Here's an excellent video which covers HTTP, APIs, and REST APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA)!

### What is SSL? (HTTPS)

## Server

### What is an IP Address?

An IP address is a unique number assigned to computer while you're connected to a computer network (using TCP/IP - there are protocols).

An IP address looks like this: **192.235.5.154**

That is an example of a IPv4 (32 bit) address, which was an early addresses protocol. There have been so many devices connecting to the internet, that IPv6 (128 bit) needed to be invented to accommodate new devices.

Just to put it into perspective, IPv4 can hold 4.2 billion unique addresses. IPv6 can hold 3.4 * 10^38 addresses!

### What happens when you click "search" on google.com?

Some amazing people detailed and described **every single step** from pressing `Enter/Return ‚èé` on your keyboard to accessing a server on a CDN.

It's amazing and it's called [what happens when?](https://github.com/what-happens-when) - it's a long read but you should read the entire thing, it's absolutely fascinating!

#### What are the differences between Client and Server?

- A "client" is what the user uses on their machine to request information from servers (websites usually).

- A "server" is a computer which handles a client's request (web page, file, video, etc.)

The web browser you're using right now is the "client" on your computer which helps you request web pages like Youtube, Facebook, or Reddit.

The client can be thought of as a customer at a restaurant. They look a menu, decide what they want, and make a request to the waiter (server) who places that order. Some time later the waiter comes back with the meal. The waiter is able to create the meal through the kitchen; when the meal was done the waiter responded to the customer's request with a completed meal.

**Note**: The customer did not go into the kitchen to make their own meal. They trusted that waiter would fulfill their request.

#### What is REST (API)
Explain endpoints, etc.
	
#### Incoming server requests (POST, GET, DELETE, PUT)

How things are routed, processed, etc.
	
#### Responding to request with HTTP

- Status Codes (https://http.cat)
- JSON, XML, PLAIN TEXT, BINARY
- Pagination

#### Some common, but important tools for servers
- Database
- Load balancer
- Message Queue

## What comes after HTTP?

### WebSockets

### Long-Polling technique
