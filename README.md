## Intro Web

Want to learn about a the web applications, servers, HTTP, and REST APIs?

Well you came to there right place!

Intro-Web consists of two parts (both you can read and do on your own if you'd like!)

#### [Guide](./reference/README.md)

The guide is an easy-to-read explanation of the concepts of web applications, the internet, and APIs. It's an excellent launchpad into understanding how services you use everyday work, and building your own web application!

Hopefully you'll have some questions after reading the guide and we'll be happy to answer them.


#### [Workshop](./workshop/README.md)

The workshop is where we **use** APIs, HTTP, and the rest. You get to experiment with the concepts covered in the guide and get some new ideas for how to use APIs!

Again, the Workshop is written such that you can do it on your own or with friends, you don't need to come to the meeting to do it (but we'll be here to help you with it :heart:).
